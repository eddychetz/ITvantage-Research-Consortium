# ITvantage Research Consortium

This group will focus on leveraging technology to gain a competitive edge, explore new possibilities, and achieve favorable outcomes in the context of the research group or organization.

# Steps

**1. Define the Goals:** Clearly define the goals and objectives of the research group. Determine what you want to achieve through the group and how it aligns with the field of Business Intelligence. Identify specific research areas or projects that you want the group to focus on.

**2. Recruit Interested Students:** Advertise the research group to attract undergraduates who are interested in Machine Learning and AI in the context of Business Intelligence. You can use various channels such as university newsletters, social media, posters, and departmental announcements to reach out to potential members.

**3. Set Up a Core Team:** Form a core team of dedicated individuals who will take responsibility for organizing and managing the research group. This team should consist of students with strong knowledge and experience in Machine Learning and AI, as well as leadership and organizational skills.

**4. Establish Regular Meetings:** Schedule regular meetings to discuss research topics, share ideas, and plan activities. These meetings can be weekly or biweekly, depending on the availability of the group members. Encourage active participation and collaboration among the members.

**5. Identify Research Projects:** Brainstorm potential research projects that align with the goals of the group. Consider real-world business problems that can benefit from the application of Machine Learning and AI techniques. Encourage students to propose their own project ideas and foster a collaborative environment for project selection.

**6. Seek Faculty Guidance:** Reach out to faculty members with expertise in Business Intelligence, Machine Learning, and AI. Seek their guidance and support for the research group. Faculty members can provide valuable insights, mentorship, and help in shaping the research projects.

**7. Access Resources:** Ensure that the research group has access to necessary resources such as computing power, software tools, datasets, and relevant literature. Collaborate with the university's IT department, library, and research labs to acquire the required resources.

**8. Collaborate with Industry Partners:** Establish connections with industry partners who work in the field of Business Intelligence and AI. Collaborating with industry can provide valuable insights, access to real-world data, and potential internship or job opportunities for the group members.

**9. Organize Workshops and Guest Talks:** Arrange workshops and guest talks by experts in the field of Machine Learning, AI, and Business Intelligence. These events can provide valuable learning opportunities, networking, and exposure to the latest trends and practices.

**10. Publish and Present Research Findings:** Encourage students to publish their research findings in relevant conferences and journals. Presenting research work at conferences and seminars can help in gaining recognition and exposure for the research group.

**11. Foster Collaboration and Networking:** Encourage collaboration and networking among the research group members. Organize group projects, hackathons, or coding competitions to foster teamwork and healthy competition.

**12. Seek Funding Opportunities:** Explore funding opportunities from the university, government agencies, or private organizations to support the research group's activities. Funding can help in acquiring resources, organizing events, and facilitating research projects.

*Remember that starting a research group requires dedication, commitment, and a supportive community. Be open to feedback, adapt to the evolving needs of the group, and celebrate the achievements of your members.*
